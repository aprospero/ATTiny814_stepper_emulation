# ATTiny814 stepper emulation
ATTiny814 Arduino Project: stepper motor ctrl signal interface to PID based H-Bridge Motor ctrl with encoder feedback .

If you always wanted to use cheap motors with encoder feedback as replacement for costly stepper motors, this Arduino IDE project for ATTiny814 (or other ATTiny from that family) does the job.
